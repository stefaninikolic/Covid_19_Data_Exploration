# Covid_19_Data_Exploration


## Project Overview
- Exploring data using a PostgreSQL database to address inquiries related to COVID-19 infections, deaths, and vaccinations. The dataset was sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).
- Using pandas and sqlalchemy libraries for SQL query execution and data reading.
- Visualizing PostgreSQL queries using Tableau.

## Objectives
Design an interactive dashboard for simple exploration, and answer the questions:
* What are the global numbers for COVID-19 cases and deaths?
* Which continent has been the most affected by COVID-19, and which one has the highest number of deaths?
* What are the countries with the highest and lowest infection rates, and how do these rates compare across continents?
* How do the projected COVID-19 infection rate trends compare with current rates, and what insights do they offer until December 2024?

## Visualizations
The dashboard can be accessed [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/stefani.nikolic/viz/COVID-19Dashboard_17071750332220/Dashboard1)
* The graph illustrates the forecasted percentage of the population infected with COVID-19 for specific countries, providing insights into future infection trends.
